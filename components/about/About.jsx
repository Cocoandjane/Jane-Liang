      <p>
        I remember the first time I stumbled upon the world of web development, I was immediately captivated by the endless possibilities it offered. I knew that this was the path I wanted to take. I embarked on a journey to master the art and science of building websites and web applications.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>After countless hours of studying and practice, I am proud to say that I have graduated as a full stack web developer, equipped with a formidable set of technical skills including HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, React, Next.js, C#, PHP, ASP.NET, MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Firebase and more.</p>
      <br/>
      <p>However, my journey didn't stop there. I also had the opportunity to gain previous experience in other fields such as office administration and retail. This allowed me to develop a diverse perspective and adaptability which I believe will be an asset in the tech industry.</p>
      <br/>
      <p>Now, I am eager to take on new challenges and apply my skills and experiences to make a meaningful impact in the tech industry. I am excited to see where this journey will take me next.</p>
